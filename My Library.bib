  abstract = {Studies of stellar populations in early-type galaxies (ETGs) show that the more massive galaxies form earlier and have a shorter star formation history (SFH). In this study, we investigate the initial conditions of ETG formation. The study begins with the collapse of non-rotating post-Big-Bang gas clouds in Milgromian (MOND) gravitation. These produce ETGs with star-forming timescales (SFT) comparable to those observed in the real Universe. Comparing these collapse models with observations, we set constraints on the initial size and density of the post-Big-Bang gas clouds in order to form ETGs. The effective-radius--mass relation of the model galaxies falls short of the observed relation. Possible mechanisms for later radius expansion are discussed. Using hydrodynamic MOND simulations this work thus for the first time shows that the SFTs observed for ETGs may be a natural occurrence in the MOND paradigm. We show that different feedback algorithms change the evolution of the galaxies only to a very minor degree in MOND. The first stars have, however, formed more rapidly in the real Universe than possible just from the here studied gravitational collapse mechanism. Dark-matter-based cosmological structure formation simulations disagree with the observed SFTs at more than 5 sigma confidence.},

  abstract = {The Lilly-Madau plot is commonly interpreted as the history of the cosmic star formation of the Universe by showing the co-moving star formation rate density (SFRD) over cosmic time. Therefore, the Lilly-Madau plot is sensitive not only to the star formation history (SFH) but also to the number density of galaxies. Assessing the Catalogue of Neighbouring Galaxies, we reconstruct the SFHs of galaxies located in the Local Cosmological Volume (LV) based on delayed-{$\tau$} and power-law SFH models. Galaxies with stellar masses of M{$\ast$} {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1010 M{$\odot$} typically evolve according to the delayed-{$\tau$} model by having first increasing followed by exponentially declining SFRs, while the majority of less massive star-forming galaxies have an almost constant or increasing SFH. Deducing the cosmic SFRD evolution of the LV reveals that the SFHs of local galaxies are inconsistent with the Lilly-Madau plot. The SFRDs of the LV are significantly lower at redshifts of z {$\lessequivlnt$} 3 underestimating the Lilly-Madau peak at z = 1.86 by a factor of 2.16 {\textpm} 0.32 (delayed-{$\tau$} model) and 5.90 {\textpm} 0.88 (power-law model). Assuming the delayed-{$\tau$} model for galaxies with M{$\ast$} â©¾ 1010 M{$\odot$} and a powerlaw model for less massive galaxies, the SFRD is 2.22 {\textpm} 0.33 lower than measured at z = 1.86. This inconsistency between the evolution of the local and global SFRD has cosmological implications. Since the Lilly-Madau plot also constrains the cosmological matter field, the near-constancy of SFHs of LV galaxies could imply that the peak of the Lilly-Madau plot at z = 1.86 is the imprint of an {$\approx$} 5 co-moving Gpc-scale inhomogeneity.},

  abstract = {Any viable cosmological framework has to match the observed proportion of early- and late-type galaxies. In this contribution, we focus on the distribution of galaxy morphological types in the standard model of cosmology (Lambda cold dark matter, {$\Lambda$}CDM). Using the latest state-of-the-art cosmological {$\Lambda$}CDM simulations known as Illustris, IllustrisTNG, and EAGLE, we calculate the intrinsic and sky-projected aspect ratio distribution of the stars in subhalos with stellar mass M{$\ast$} {$>$} 1010 M at redshift z = 0. There is a significant deficit of intrinsically thin disk galaxies, which however comprise most of the locally observed galaxy population. Consequently, the sky-projected aspect ratio distribution produced by these {$\Lambda$}CDM simulations disagrees with the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and Sloan Digital Sky Survey at {$\geq$} 12.52{$\sigma$} (TNG50-1) and {$\geq$} 14.82{$\sigma$} (EAGLE50) confidence. The deficit of intrinsically thin galaxies could be due to a much less hierarchical mergerdriven build-up of observed galaxies than is given by the {$\Lambda$}CDM framework. It might also arise from the implemented sub-grid models, or from the limited resolution of the above-mentioned hydrodynamical simulations. We estimate that an 85 times better mass resolution realization than TNG50-1 would reduce the tension with GAMA to the 5.58{$\sigma$} level. Finally, we show that galaxies with fewer major mergers have a somewhat thinner aspect ratio distribution. Given also the high expected frequency of minor mergers in {$\Lambda$}CDM, the problem may be due to minor mergers. In this case, the angular momentum problem could be alleviated in Milgromian dynamics (MOND) because of a reduced merger frequency arising from the absence of dynamical friction between extended dark matter halos.},

We present a compiled list of 1217 star formation rate (SFR) estimates for 802 galaxies within 11 Mpc, derived from the H{$\alpha$} imaging surveys and the GALEX far-ultraviolet survey. We briefly discuss some basic scaling relations between SFR and luminosity, morphology, H i mass, surface brightness, and the environment of the galaxies. About 3/4 of our sample consist of dwarf galaxies, for which we offer a more refined classification. We note that the specific SFR of nearly all luminous and dwarf galaxies does not exceed the maximum value: log(SFR/LK ) = -9.4 [yr-1]. Most spiral and blue dwarf galaxies have enough time to generate their stellar mass during the cosmological time, T0, with the observed SFRs. They dispose of a sufficient amount of gas to support their present SFRs over the next T0 term. We note that only a small fraction of BCD, Im, and Ir galaxies (about 1/20) proceed in a mode of vigorous starburst activity. In general, the star formation history of spiral and blue dwarf galaxies is mainly driven by their internal processes. The present SFRs of E, S0, and dSph galaxies typically have 1/30--1/300 of their former activity.},

It collects data on the following galaxy observables: angular diameters, apparent magnitudes in far-UV, B, and Ks bands, H{$\alpha$} and H i fluxes, morphological types, H i-line widths, radial velocities, and distance estimates. In this Local Volume (LV) sample, 108 dwarf galaxies still remain without measured radial velocities. The catalog yields also calculated global galaxy parameters: linear Holmberg diameter, absolute B magnitude, surface brightness, H i mass, stellar mass estimated via K-band luminosity, H i rotational velocity corrected for galaxy inclination, indicative mass within the Holmberg radius, and three kinds of ``tidal index,'' which quantify the local density environment. The catalog is supplemented with data based on the local galaxies, which presents their optical and available H{$\alpha$} images, as well as other services. We briefly discuss the Hubble flow within the LV and different scaling relations that characterize galaxy structure and global star formation in them. We also trace the behavior of the mean stellar mass density, H i-mass density, and star formation rate density within the volume considered.},

This is in tension with the evolution of galaxies described by delayed-{$\tau$} models, according to which the opposite would be expected. The tension is apparent in that local galaxies imply the star formation time-scale {$\tau~\approx$} 6.7~Gyr, much longer than the 3.5--4.5~Gyr obtained using an empirically determined main sequence at several redshifts. Using models where the SFR is a power law in time of the form {$\propto$}(t - t1){$\eta$} for t1~= 1.8~Gyr (with no stars forming prior to t1) implies that {$\eta~$}= 0.18~{\textpm}~0.03. This suggested near-constancy of a galaxy's SFR over time raises non-trivial problems for the evolution and formation time of galaxies, but is broadly consistent with the observed decreasing main sequence with increasing age of the Universe.},

SPARC spans a broad range of morphologies (S0 to Irr), luminosities ({$\sim$}5 dex), and surface brightnesses ({$\sim$}4 dex). We derive [3.6] surface photometry and study structural relations of stellar and gas disks. We find that both the stellar mass--H i mass relation and the stellar radius--H i radius relation have significant intrinsic scatter, while the H i mass--radius relation is extremely tight. We build detailed mass models and quantify the ratio of baryonic to observed velocity (Vbar/Vobs) for different characteristic radii and values of the stellar mass-to-light ratio ({$\Upsilon\star$}) at [3.6]. Assuming {$\Upsilon\star$} {$\simeq$} 0.5 M{$\odot$}/L{$\odot$} (as suggested by stellar population models), we find that (i) the gas fraction linearly correlates with total luminosity; (ii) the transition from star-dominated to gas-dominated galaxies roughly corresponds to the transition from spiral galaxies to dwarf irregulars, in line with density wave theory; and (iii) Vbar/Vobs varies with luminosity and surface brightness: high-mass, high-surface-brightness galaxies are nearly maximal, while low-mass, low-surface-brightness galaxies are submaximal. These basic properties are lost for low values of {$\Upsilon\star$} {$\simeq$} 0.2 M{$\odot$}/L{$\odot$} as suggested by the DiskMass survey. The mean maximum-disk limit in bright galaxies is {$\Upsilon\star$} {$\simeq$} 0.7 M{$\odot$}/L{$\odot$} at [3.6].

The scale lengths and gas fractions are based on observed galaxies, and the simulations are run for 5 Gyr. The main aim is to see whether the existing sub-grid physics prescriptions for star formation and stellar feedback reproduce the observed main sequence and reasonably match the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, which captures how the local and global star formation rates relate to other properties. Star formation in the models starts soon after initialization and continues as the models evolve. The initialized galaxies indeed evolve to a state which is on the observed main sequence and the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. The available formulation of sub-grid physics is therefore adequate and leads to galaxies that largely behave like observed galaxies, grow in radius, and have flat rotation curves - provided we use Milgromian gravitation. Furthermore, the strength of the bars tends to be inversely correlated with the stellar mass of the galaxy, whereas the bar length strongly correlates with the stellar mass. Irrespective of the mass, the bar pattern speed stays constant with time, indicating that dynamical friction does not affect the bar dynamics. The models demonstrate Renzo's rule and form structures at large radii, much as in real galaxies. In this framework, baryonic physics is thus sufficiently understood to not pose major uncertainties in our modelling of global galaxy properties.},

  abstract = {Analyzing resolved stellar populations across the disk of a galaxy can provide unique insights into how that galaxy assembled its stellar mass over its lifetime. Previous work at {$\sim$}1 kpc resolution has already revealed common features in the mass buildup (e.g., inside-out growth of galaxies). However, even at approximate kpc scales, the stellar populations are blurred between the different galactic morphological structures such as spiral arms, bars and bulges. Here we present a detailed analysis of the spatially resolved star formation histories (SFHs) of 19 PHANGS-MUSE galaxies, at a spatial resolution of {$\sim$} 100 pc. We show that our sample of local galaxies exhibits predominantly negative radial gradients of stellar age and metallicity, consistent with previous findings, and a radial structure that is primarily consistent with local star formation, and indicative of inside-out formation. In barred galaxies, we find flatter metallicity gradients along the semi-major axis of the bar than along the semi-minor axis, as is expected from the radial mixing of material along the bar during infall. In general, the derived assembly histories of the galaxies in our sample tell a consistent story of inside-out growth, where low-mass galaxies assembled the majority of their stellar mass later in cosmic history than high-mass galaxies (also known as ``downsizing''). We also show how stellar populations of different ages exhibit different kinematics. Specifically, we find that younger stellar populations have lower velocity dispersions than older stellar populations at similar galactocentric distances, which we interpret as an imprint of the progressive dynamical heating of stellar populations as they age. Finally, we explore how the time-averaged star formation rate evolves with time, and how it varies across galactic disks. This analysis reveals a wide variation of the SFHs of galaxy centers and additionally shows that structural features become less pronounced with age.},

  abstract = {Stars do not form continuously distributed over star forming galaxies. They form in star clusters of different masses. This nature of clustered star formation is taken into account in the theory of the integrated galactic stellar initial mass function (IGIMF) in which the galaxy-wide IMF (the IGIMF) is calculated by adding all IMFs of young star clusters. For massive stars the IGIMF is steeper than the universal IMF in star clusters and steepens with decreasing SFR which is called the IGIMF-effect. The current SFR and the total H{$\alpha$} luminosity of galaxies therefore scale non-linearly in the IGIMF theory compared to the classical case in which the galaxy-wide IMF is assumed to be constant and identical to the IMF in star clusters. We here apply for the first time the revised SFR-LH{$\alpha$} relation on a sample of local volume star forming galaxies with measured H{$\alpha$} luminosities. The fundamental results are: i) the SFRs of galaxies scale linearly with the total galaxy neutral gas mass, ii) the gas depletion time scales of dwarf irregular and large disk galaxies are about 3 Gyr implying that dwarf galaxies do not have lower star formation efficiencies than large disk galaxies, and iii) the stellar mass buildup times of dwarf and large galaxies are only in agreement with downsizing in the IGIMF context, but contradict downsizing within the traditional framework that assumes a constant galaxy-wide IMF.},
