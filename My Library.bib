  abstract = {Parametric models for galaxy star formation histories (SFHs) are widely used, though they are known to impose strong priors on physical parameters. This has consequences for measurements of the galaxy stellar-mass function, star formation rate density (SFRD), and star-forming main sequence (SFMS). We investigate the effects of the exponentially declining, delayed exponentially declining, lognormal, and double power-law SFH models using BAGPIPES. We demonstrate that each of these models imposes strong priors on specific star formation rates (SFRs), potentially biasing the SFMS, and also imposes a strong prior preference for young stellar populations. We show that stellar mass, SFR, and mass-weighted age inferences from high-quality mock photometry vary with the choice of SFH model by at least 0.1, 0.3, and 0.2 dex, respectively. However, the biases with respect to the true values depend more on the true SFH shape than the choice of model. We also demonstrate that photometric data cannot discriminate between SFH models, meaning that it is important to perform independent tests to find well-motivated priors. We finally fit a low-redshift, volume-complete sample of galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) Survey with each model. We demonstrate that our stellar masses and SFRs at redshift z∼0.05 are consistent with other analyses. However, our inferred cosmic SFRDs peak at z∼0.4, approximately 6 Gyr later than direct observations suggest, meaning that our mass-weighted ages are significantly underestimated. This makes the use of parametric SFH models for understanding mass assembly in galaxies challenging. In a companion paper, we consider nonparametric SFH models.},

  abstract = {We present here a simple model for the star formation history (SFH) of galaxies that is successful in describing both the star formation rate density (SFRD) over cosmic time, as well as the distribution of specific star formation rates (sSFRs) of galaxies at the current epoch, and the evolution of this quantity in galaxy populations to a redshift of z = 1. We show first that the cosmic SFRD is remarkably well described by a simple log-normal in time. We next postulate that this functional form for the ensemble is also a reasonable description for the SFHs of individual galaxies. Using the measured sSFRs for galaxies at z ∼ 0 from Paper III in this series, we then construct a realization of a universe populated by such galaxies in which the parameters of the log-normal SFH of each galaxy are adjusted to match the sSFRs at z ∼ 0 as well as fitting, in ensemble, the cosmic SFRD from z = 0 to z = 8. This model predicts, with striking fidelity, the distribution of sSFRs in mass-limited galaxy samples to z = 1; this match is not achieved by other models with a different functional form for the SFHs of individual galaxies, but with the same number of degrees of freedom, suggesting that the log-normal form is well matched to the likely actual histories of individual galaxies. We also impose the sSFR versus mass distributions at higher redshifts from Paper III as constraints on the model, and show that, as previously suggested, some galaxies in the field, particularly low mass galaxies, are quite young at intermediate redshifts. As emphasized in Paper III, starbursts are insufficient to explain the enhanced sSFRs in intermediate redshift galaxies; we show here that a model using only smoothly varying log-normal SFHs for galaxies, which allows for some fraction of the population to have peak star formation at late times, does however fully explain the observations. Finally, we show that this model, constrained in detail only at redshifts z {$<$} 1, also produces the main sequence of star-formation observed at 1.5 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.5, again suggesting that the log-normal SFHs are a close approximation to the actual histories of typical galaxies.},

  abstract = {The Lilly-Madau plot is commonly interpreted as the history of the cosmic star formation of the Universe by showing the co-moving star formation rate density (SFRD) over cosmic time. Therefore, the Lilly-Madau plot is sensitive not only to the star formation history (SFH) but also to the number density of galaxies. Assessing the Catalogue of Neighbouring Galaxies, we reconstruct the SFHs of galaxies located in the Local Cosmological Volume (LV) based on delayed-τ and power-law SFH models. Galaxies with stellar masses of M∗ ≳ 1010 M⊙ typically evolve according to the delayed-τ model by having first increasing followed by exponentially declining SFRs, while the majority of less massive star-forming galaxies have an almost constant or increasing SFH. Deducing the cosmic SFRD evolution of the LV reveals that the SFHs of local galaxies are inconsistent with the Lilly-Madau plot. The SFRDs of the LV are significantly lower at redshifts of z ≲ 3 underestimating the Lilly-Madau peak at z = 1.86 by a factor of 2.16 ± 0.32 (delayed-τ model) and 5.90 ± 0.88 (power-law model). Assuming the delayed-τ model for galaxies with M∗ ⩾ 1010 M⊙ and a powerlaw model for less massive galaxies, the SFRD is 2.22 ± 0.33 lower than measured at z = 1.86. This inconsistency between the evolution of the local and global SFRD has cosmological implications. Since the Lilly-Madau plot also constrains the cosmological matter field, the near-constancy of SFHs of LV galaxies could imply that the peak of the Lilly-Madau plot at z = 1.86 is the imprint of an ≈ 5 co-moving Gpc-scale inhomogeneity.},

We present a compiled list of 1217 star formation rate (SFR) estimates for 802 galaxies within 11 Mpc, derived from the Hα imaging surveys and the GALEX far-ultraviolet survey. We briefly discuss some basic scaling relations between SFR and luminosity, morphology, H i mass, surface brightness, and the environment of the galaxies. About 3/4 of our sample consist of dwarf galaxies, for which we offer a more refined classification. We note that the specific SFR of nearly all luminous and dwarf galaxies does not exceed the maximum value: log(SFR/LK ) = −9.4 [yr−1]. Most spiral and blue dwarf galaxies have enough time to generate their stellar mass during the cosmological time, T0, with the observed SFRs. They dispose of a sufficient amount of gas to support their present SFRs over the next T0 term. We note that only a small fraction of BCD, Im, and Ir galaxies (about 1/20) proceed in a mode of vigorous starburst activity. In general, the star formation history of spiral and blue dwarf galaxies is mainly driven by their internal processes. The present SFRs of E, S0, and dSph galaxies typically have 1/30–1/300 of their former activity.},

The catalog is a renewed and expanded version of the Catalog of Neighboring Galaxies by Karachentsev et al. It collects data on the following galaxy observables: angular diameters, apparent magnitudes in far-UV, B, and Ks bands, Hα and H i fluxes, morphological types, H i-line widths, radial velocities, and distance estimates. In this Local Volume (LV) sample, 108 dwarf galaxies still remain without measured radial velocities. The catalog yields also calculated global galaxy parameters: linear Holmberg diameter, absolute B magnitude, surface brightness, H i mass, stellar mass estimated via K-band luminosity, H i rotational velocity corrected for galaxy inclination, indicative mass within the Holmberg radius, and three kinds of “tidal index,” which quantify the local density environment. The catalog is supplemented with data based on the local galaxies, which presents their optical and available Hα images, as well as other services. We briefly discuss the Hubble flow within the LV and different scaling relations that characterize galaxy structure and global star formation in them. We also trace the behavior of the mean stellar mass density, H i-mass density, and star formation rate density within the volume considered.},

This is in tension with the evolution of galaxies described by delayed-τ models, according to which the opposite would be expected. The tension is apparent in that local galaxies imply the star formation time-scale τ~≈ 6.7~Gyr, much longer than the 3.5–4.5~Gyr obtained using an empirically determined main sequence at several redshifts. Using models where the SFR is a power law in time of the form ∝(t − t1)η for t1~= 1.8~Gyr (with no stars forming prior to t1) implies that η~= 0.18~±~0.03. This suggested near-constancy of a galaxy’s SFR over time raises non-trivial problems for the evolution and formation time of galaxies, but is broadly consistent with the observed decreasing main sequence with increasing age of the Universe.},

SPARC spans a broad range of morphologies (S0 to Irr), luminosities (∼5 dex), and surface brightnesses (∼4 dex). We derive [3.6] surface photometry and study structural relations of stellar and gas disks. We find that both the stellar mass–H i mass relation and the stellar radius–H i radius relation have significant intrinsic scatter, while the H i mass–radius relation is extremely tight. We build detailed mass models and quantify the ratio of baryonic to observed velocity (Vbar/Vobs) for different characteristic radii and values of the stellar mass-to-light ratio (ϒ⋆) at [3.6]. Assuming ϒ⋆ ≃ 0.5 M⊙/L⊙ (as suggested by stellar population models), we find that (i) the gas fraction linearly correlates with total luminosity; (ii) the transition from star-dominated to gas-dominated galaxies roughly corresponds to the transition from spiral galaxies to dwarf irregulars, in line with density wave theory; and (iii) Vbar/Vobs varies with luminosity and surface brightness: high-mass, high-surface-brightness galaxies are nearly maximal, while low-mass, low-surface-brightness galaxies are submaximal. These basic properties are lost for low values of ϒ⋆ ≃ 0.2 M⊙/L⊙ as suggested by the DiskMass survey. The mean maximum-disk limit in bright galaxies is ϒ⋆ ≃ 0.7 M⊙/L⊙ at [3.6].

The scale lengths and gas fractions are based on observed galaxies, and the simulations are run for 5 Gyr. The main aim is to see whether the existing sub-grid physics prescriptions for star formation and stellar feedback reproduce the observed main sequence and reasonably match the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, which captures how the local and global star formation rates relate to other properties. Star formation in the models starts soon after initialization and continues as the models evolve. The initialized galaxies indeed evolve to a state which is on the observed main sequence and the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. The available formulation of sub-grid physics is therefore adequate and leads to galaxies that largely behave like observed galaxies, grow in radius, and have flat rotation curves - provided we use Milgromian gravitation. Furthermore, the strength of the bars tends to be inversely correlated with the stellar mass of the galaxy, whereas the bar length strongly correlates with the stellar mass. Irrespective of the mass, the bar pattern speed stays constant with time, indicating that dynamical friction does not affect the bar dynamics. The models demonstrate Renzo's rule and form structures at large radii, much as in real galaxies. In this framework, baryonic physics is thus sufficiently understood to not pose major uncertainties in our modelling of global galaxy properties.},

  abstract = {Stars do not form continuously distributed over star forming galaxies. They form in star clusters of different masses. This nature of clustered star formation is taken into account in the theory of the integrated galactic stellar initial mass function (IGIMF) in which the galaxy-wide IMF (the IGIMF) is calculated by adding all IMFs of young star clusters. For massive stars the IGIMF is steeper than the universal IMF in star clusters and steepens with decreasing SFR which is called the IGIMF-effect. The current SFR and the total Hα luminosity of galaxies therefore scale non-linearly in the IGIMF theory compared to the classical case in which the galaxy-wide IMF is assumed to be constant and identical to the IMF in star clusters. We here apply for the first time the revised SFR-LHα relation on a sample of local volume star forming galaxies with measured Hα luminosities. The fundamental results are: i) the SFRs of galaxies scale linearly with the total galaxy neutral gas mass, ii) the gas depletion time scales of dwarf irregular and large disk galaxies are about 3 Gyr implying that dwarf galaxies do not have lower star formation efficiencies than large disk galaxies, and iii) the stellar mass buildup times of dwarf and large galaxies are only in agreement with downsizing in the IGIMF context, but contradict downsizing within the traditional framework that assumes a constant galaxy-wide IMF.},

By fitting for time evolution of the MS in bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS within each observed redshift bins. After accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS distribution is ∼ 0.2 dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our best fit log SFR(M∗, t) = (0.84 ± 0.02 − 0.026 ± 0.003 × t) log M∗−(6.51 ± 0.24 − 0.11 ± 0.03 × t), with t the age of the Universe in Gyr. We use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks in order to constrain MS galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), finding that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by delayed-τ models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth for a “typical” MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial 1σ spread in formation times of ∼ 1.4 Gyr.},
