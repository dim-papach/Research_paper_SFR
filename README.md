# Research Paper SFR

My research paper, during my stay in Bonn and now my thesis, about the SFR and the varius masses of the of the LCV

# What is the paper about

From the paper "Constraints on the star formation histories of galaxies in the Local Cosmological Volume" Dr. P. Kroupa and his team observed some tensions between the delayed-Ï„ model and the observation from the "The Catalogue of Neighbouring Galaxies" (Karachentsev, Makarov & Kaisina et al. 2013). In this paper we will try to expand on Dr. Kroupa's findings and see if the model is in fact in tension with the data and what changes we can do to fix it.

For my thesis I started over. Let's do it right this time!
