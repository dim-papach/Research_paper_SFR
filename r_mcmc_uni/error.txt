Chain 1 Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Chain 1 Exception: normal_lpdf: Location parameter[1] is inf, but must be finite! (in '/tmp/RtmpGHrCVx/model-15a7537181dfb.stan', line 59, column 2 to column 46)
Chain 1 If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
Chain 1 but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.

Chain 2 Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
