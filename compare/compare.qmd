# The data

In this script we will compare out 2 catalogs @kovlakasHeraklionExtragalacticCatalogue2021 and [@karachentsevUPDATEDNEARBYGALAXY2013, @karachentsevSTARFORMATIONPROPERTIES2013a]

-   The data have been joined based on their position in the sky (Ra, Dec, Distance).
-   We use TOPCAT to create two joins, an inner and an outer join
-   We will use the inner join for 1-1 comparisons
-   If we see that the data are similar we can use the outer join

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
from astropy.io import ascii
from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
from astropy.table import Table, join, QTable
import astropy.units as u
from astropy.visualization import quantity_support
import glob
import os

dt = QTable(ascii.read("../tables/inner_join.ecsv"), masked=True)
dt.info()
```

```{python}
