This has consequences for measurements of the galaxy stellar-mass function, star formation rate density (SFRD), and star-forming main sequence (SFMS). We investigate the effects of the exponentially declining, delayed exponentially declining, lognormal, and double power-law SFH models using BAGPIPES. We demonstrate that each of these models imposes strong priors on specific star formation rates (SFRs), potentially biasing the SFMS, and also imposes a strong prior preference for young stellar populations. We show that stellar mass, SFR, and mass-weighted age inferences from high-quality mock photometry vary with the choice of SFH model by at least 0.1, 0.3, and 0.2 dex, respectively.

We also demonstrate that photometric data cannot discriminate between SFH models, meaning that it is important to perform independent tests to find well-motivated priors. We finally fit a low-redshift, volume-complete sample of galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) Survey with each model. We demonstrate that our stellar masses and SFRs at redshift z∼0.05 are consistent with other analyses. However, our inferred cosmic SFRDs peak at z∼0.4, approximately 6 Gyr later than direct observations suggest, meaning that our mass-weighted ages are significantly underestimated.

  abstract = {Studies of stellar populations in early-type galaxies (ETGs) show that the more massive galaxies form earlier and have a shorter star formation history (SFH). In this study, we investigate the initial conditions of ETG formation. The study begins with the collapse of non-rotating post-Big-Bang gas clouds in Milgromian (MOND) gravitation. These produce ETGs with star-forming timescales (SFT) comparable to those observed in the real Universe. Comparing these collapse models with observations, we set constraints on the initial size and density of the post-Big-Bang gas clouds in order to form ETGs. The effective-radius–mass relation of the model galaxies falls short of the observed relation. Possible mechanisms for later radius expansion are discussed. Using hydrodynamic MOND simulations this work thus for the first time shows that the SFTs observed for ETGs may be a natural occurrence in the MOND paradigm. We show that different feedback algorithms change the evolution of the galaxies only to a very minor degree in MOND. The first stars have, however, formed more rapidly in the real Universe than possible just from the here studied gravitational collapse mechanism. Dark-matter-based cosmological structure formation simulations disagree with the observed SFTs at more than 5 sigma confidence.},

  abstract = {We present here a simple model for the star formation history (SFH) of galaxies that is successful in describing both the star formation rate density (SFRD) over cosmic time, as well as the distribution of specific star formation rates (sSFRs) of galaxies at the current epoch, and the evolution of this quantity in galaxy populations to a redshift of z = 1. We show first that the cosmic SFRD is remarkably well described by a simple log-normal in time. We next postulate that this functional form for the ensemble is also a reasonable description for the SFHs of individual galaxies. Using the measured sSFRs for galaxies at z ∼ 0 from Paper III in this series, we then construct a realization of a universe populated by such galaxies in which the parameters of the log-normal SFH of each galaxy are adjusted to match the sSFRs at z ∼ 0 as well as fitting, in ensemble, the cosmic SFRD from z = 0 to z = 8. This model predicts, with striking fidelity, the distribution of sSFRs in mass-limited galaxy samples to z = 1; this match is not achieved by other models with a different functional form for the SFHs of individual galaxies, but with the same number of degrees of freedom, suggesting that the log-normal form is well matched to the likely actual histories of individual galaxies. We also impose the sSFR versus mass distributions at higher redshifts from Paper III as constraints on the model, and show that, as previously suggested, some galaxies in the field, particularly low mass galaxies, are quite young at intermediate redshifts. As emphasized in Paper III, starbursts are insufficient to explain the enhanced sSFRs in intermediate redshift galaxies; we show here that a model using only smoothly varying log-normal SFHs for galaxies, which allows for some fraction of the population to have peak star formation at late times, does however fully explain the observations. Finally, we show that this model, constrained in detail only at redshifts z {$<$} 1, also produces the main sequence of star-formation observed at 1.5 {$<$} z {$<$} 2.5, again suggesting that the log-normal SFHs are a close approximation to the actual histories of typical galaxies.},

  abstract = {Astronomical observations of extended sources, such as cubes of integral field spectroscopy (IFS), encode autocorrelated spatial structures that cannot be optimally exploited by standard methodologies. This work introduces a novel technique to model IFS data sets, which treats the observed galaxy properties as realizations of an unobserved Gaussian Markov random field. The method is computationally efficient, resilient to the presence of low-signal-to-noise regions, and uses an alternative to Markov Chain Monte Carlo for fast Bayesian inference – the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation. As a case study, we analyse 721 IFS data cubes of nearby galaxies from the CALIFA and PISCO surveys, for which we retrieve the maps of the following physical properties: age, metallicity, mass, and extinction. The proposed Bayesian approach, built on a generative representation of the galaxy properties, enables the creation of synthetic images, recovery of areas with bad pixels, and an increased power to detect structures in data sets subject to substantial noise and/or sparsity of sampling. A snippet code to reproduce the analysis of this paper is available in the COIN toolbox, together with the field reconstructions of the CALIFA and PISCO samples.},

  abstract = {The Lilly-Madau plot is commonly interpreted as the history of the cosmic star formation of the Universe by showing the co-moving star formation rate density (SFRD) over cosmic time. Therefore, the Lilly-Madau plot is sensitive not only to the star formation history (SFH) but also to the number density of galaxies. Assessing the Catalogue of Neighbouring Galaxies, we reconstruct the SFHs of galaxies located in the Local Cosmological Volume (LV) based on delayed-τ and power-law SFH models. Galaxies with stellar masses of M∗ ≳ 1010 M⊙ typically evolve according to the delayed-τ model by having first increasing followed by exponentially declining SFRs, while the majority of less massive star-forming galaxies have an almost constant or increasing SFH. Deducing the cosmic SFRD evolution of the LV reveals that the SFHs of local galaxies are inconsistent with the Lilly-Madau plot. The SFRDs of the LV are significantly lower at redshifts of z ≲ 3 underestimating the Lilly-Madau peak at z = 1.86 by a factor of 2.16 ± 0.32 (delayed-τ model) and 5.90 ± 0.88 (power-law model). Assuming the delayed-τ model for galaxies with M∗ ⩾ 1010 M⊙ and a powerlaw model for less massive galaxies, the SFRD is 2.22 ± 0.33 lower than measured at z = 1.86. This inconsistency between the evolution of the local and global SFRD has cosmological implications. Since the Lilly-Madau plot also constrains the cosmological matter field, the near-constancy of SFHs of LV galaxies could imply that the peak of the Lilly-Madau plot at z = 1.86 is the imprint of an ≈ 5 co-moving Gpc-scale inhomogeneity.},

  abstract = {Any viable cosmological framework has to match the observed proportion of early- and late-type galaxies. In this contribution, we focus on the distribution of galaxy morphological types in the standard model of cosmology (Lambda cold dark matter, ΛCDM). Using the latest state-of-the-art cosmological ΛCDM simulations known as Illustris, IllustrisTNG, and EAGLE, we calculate the intrinsic and sky-projected aspect ratio distribution of the stars in subhalos with stellar mass M∗ {$>$} 1010 M at redshift z = 0. There is a significant deficit of intrinsically thin disk galaxies, which however comprise most of the locally observed galaxy population. Consequently, the sky-projected aspect ratio distribution produced by these ΛCDM simulations disagrees with the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and Sloan Digital Sky Survey at ≥ 12.52σ (TNG50-1) and ≥ 14.82σ (EAGLE50) confidence. The deficit of intrinsically thin galaxies could be due to a much less hierarchical mergerdriven build-up of observed galaxies than is given by the ΛCDM framework. It might also arise from the implemented sub-grid models, or from the limited resolution of the above-mentioned hydrodynamical simulations. We estimate that an 85 times better mass resolution realization than TNG50-1 would reduce the tension with GAMA to the 5.58σ level. Finally, we show that galaxies with fewer major mergers have a somewhat thinner aspect ratio distribution. Given also the high expected frequency of minor mergers in ΛCDM, the problem may be due to minor mergers. In this case, the angular momentum problem could be alleviated in Milgromian dynamics (MOND) because of a reduced merger frequency arising from the absence of dynamical friction between extended dark matter halos.},

It collects data on the following galaxy observables: angular diameters, apparent magnitudes in far-UV, B, and Ks bands, Hα and H i fluxes, morphological types, H i-line widths, radial velocities, and distance estimates. In this Local Volume (LV) sample, 108 dwarf galaxies still remain without measured radial velocities. The catalog yields also calculated global galaxy parameters: linear Holmberg diameter, absolute B magnitude, surface brightness, H i mass, stellar mass estimated via K-band luminosity, H i rotational velocity corrected for galaxy inclination, indicative mass within the Holmberg radius, and three kinds of “tidal index,” which quantify the local density environment. The catalog is supplemented with data based on the local galaxies, which presents their optical and available Hα images, as well as other services. We briefly discuss the Hubble flow within the LV and different scaling relations that characterize galaxy structure and global star formation in them.

This is in tension with the evolution of galaxies described by delayed-τ models, according to which the opposite would be expected. The tension is apparent in that local galaxies imply the star formation time-scale τ~≈ 6.7~Gyr, much longer than the 3.5–4.5~Gyr obtained using an empirically determined main sequence at several redshifts. Using models where the SFR is a power law in time of the form ∝(t − t1)η for t1~= 1.8~Gyr (with no stars forming prior to t1) implies that η~= 0.18~±~0.03. This suggested near-constancy of a galaxy’s SFR over time raises non-trivial problems for the evolution and formation time of galaxies, but is broadly consistent with the observed decreasing main sequence with increasing age of the Universe.},

SPARC spans a broad range of morphologies (S0 to Irr), luminosities (∼5 dex), and surface brightnesses (∼4 dex). We derive [3.6] surface photometry and study structural relations of stellar and gas disks. We find that both the stellar mass–H i mass relation and the stellar radius–H i radius relation have significant intrinsic scatter, while the H i mass–radius relation is extremely tight. We build detailed mass models and quantify the ratio of baryonic to observed velocity (Vbar/Vobs) for different characteristic radii and values of the stellar mass-to-light ratio (ϒ⋆) at [3.6]. Assuming ϒ⋆ ≃ 0.5 M⊙/L⊙ (as suggested by stellar population models), we find that (i) the gas fraction linearly correlates with total luminosity; (ii) the transition from star-dominated to gas-dominated galaxies roughly corresponds to the transition from spiral galaxies to dwarf irregulars, in line with density wave theory; and (iii) Vbar/Vobs varies with luminosity and surface brightness: high-mass, high-surface-brightness galaxies are nearly maximal, while low-mass, low-surface-brightness galaxies are submaximal. These basic properties are lost for low values of ϒ⋆ ≃ 0.2 M⊙/L⊙ as suggested by the DiskMass survey. The mean maximum-disk limit in bright galaxies is ϒ⋆ ≃ 0.7 M⊙/L⊙ at [3.6].

The scale lengths and gas fractions are based on observed galaxies, and the simulations are run for 5 Gyr. The main aim is to see whether the existing sub-grid physics prescriptions for star formation and stellar feedback reproduce the observed main sequence and reasonably match the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, which captures how the local and global star formation rates relate to other properties. Star formation in the models starts soon after initialization and continues as the models evolve. The initialized galaxies indeed evolve to a state which is on the observed main sequence and the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. The available formulation of sub-grid physics is therefore adequate and leads to galaxies that largely behave like observed galaxies, grow in radius, and have flat rotation curves - provided we use Milgromian gravitation. Furthermore, the strength of the bars tends to be inversely correlated with the stellar mass of the galaxy, whereas the bar length strongly correlates with the stellar mass. Irrespective of the mass, the bar pattern speed stays constant with time, indicating that dynamical friction does not affect the bar dynamics. The models demonstrate Renzo's rule and form structures at large radii, much as in real galaxies. In this framework, baryonic physics is thus sufficiently understood to not pose major uncertainties in our modelling of global galaxy properties.},

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple "universal" profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r-2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

  abstract = {Analyzing resolved stellar populations across the disk of a galaxy can provide unique insights into how that galaxy assembled its stellar mass over its lifetime. Previous work at ∼1 kpc resolution has already revealed common features in the mass buildup (e.g., inside-out growth of galaxies). However, even at approximate kpc scales, the stellar populations are blurred between the different galactic morphological structures such as spiral arms, bars and bulges. Here we present a detailed analysis of the spatially resolved star formation histories (SFHs) of 19 PHANGS-MUSE galaxies, at a spatial resolution of ∼ 100 pc. We show that our sample of local galaxies exhibits predominantly negative radial gradients of stellar age and metallicity, consistent with previous findings, and a radial structure that is primarily consistent with local star formation, and indicative of inside-out formation. In barred galaxies, we find flatter metallicity gradients along the semi-major axis of the bar than along the semi-minor axis, as is expected from the radial mixing of material along the bar during infall. In general, the derived assembly histories of the galaxies in our sample tell a consistent story of inside-out growth, where low-mass galaxies assembled the majority of their stellar mass later in cosmic history than high-mass galaxies (also known as “downsizing”). We also show how stellar populations of different ages exhibit different kinematics. Specifically, we find that younger stellar populations have lower velocity dispersions than older stellar populations at similar galactocentric distances, which we interpret as an imprint of the progressive dynamical heating of stellar populations as they age. Finally, we explore how the time-averaged star formation rate evolves with time, and how it varies across galactic disks. This analysis reveals a wide variation of the SFHs of galaxy centers and additionally shows that structural features become less pronounced with age.},

  abstract = {Stars do not form continuously distributed over star forming galaxies. They form in star clusters of different masses. This nature of clustered star formation is taken into account in the theory of the integrated galactic stellar initial mass function (IGIMF) in which the galaxy-wide IMF (the IGIMF) is calculated by adding all IMFs of young star clusters. For massive stars the IGIMF is steeper than the universal IMF in star clusters and steepens with decreasing SFR which is called the IGIMF-effect. The current SFR and the total Hα luminosity of galaxies therefore scale non-linearly in the IGIMF theory compared to the classical case in which the galaxy-wide IMF is assumed to be constant and identical to the IMF in star clusters. We here apply for the first time the revised SFR-LHα relation on a sample of local volume star forming galaxies with measured Hα luminosities. The fundamental results are: i) the SFRs of galaxies scale linearly with the total galaxy neutral gas mass, ii) the gas depletion time scales of dwarf irregular and large disk galaxies are about 3 Gyr implying that dwarf galaxies do not have lower star formation efficiencies than large disk galaxies, and iii) the stellar mass buildup times of dwarf and large galaxies are only in agreement with downsizing in the IGIMF context, but contradict downsizing within the traditional framework that assumes a constant galaxy-wide IMF.},

  abstract = {Using a compilation of 25 studies from the literature, we investigate the evolution of the star-forming galaxy (SFG) Main Sequence (MS) in stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) out to z ∼ 6. After converting all observations to a common set of calibrations, we find a remarkable consensus among MS observations (∼ 0.1 dex 1σ interpublication scatter). By fitting for time evolution of the MS in bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS within each observed redshift bins. After accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS distribution is ∼ 0.2 dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our best fit log SFR(M∗, t) = (0.84 ± 0.02 − 0.026 ± 0.003 × t) log M∗−(6.51 ± 0.24 − 0.11 ± 0.03 × t), with t the age of the Universe in Gyr. We use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks in order to constrain MS galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), finding that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by delayed-τ models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth for a “typical” MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial 1σ spread in formation times of ∼ 1.4 Gyr.},
