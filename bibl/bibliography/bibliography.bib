  abstract = {We present an all-sky catalog of 869 nearby galaxies having individual distance estimates within 11 Mpc or corrected radial velocities VLG {$<$} 600 km s-1. The catalog is a renewed and expanded version of the Catalog of Neighboring Galaxies by Karachentsev et al. It collects data on the following galaxy observables: angular diameters, apparent magnitudes in far-UV, B, and Ks bands, H{$\alpha$} and H i fluxes, morphological types, H i-line widths, radial velocities, and distance estimates. In this Local Volume (LV) sample, 108 dwarf galaxies still remain without measured radial velocities. The catalog yields also calculated global galaxy parameters: linear Holmberg diameter, absolute B magnitude, surface brightness, H i mass, stellar mass estimated via K-band luminosity, H i rotational velocity corrected for galaxy inclination, indicative mass within the Holmberg radius, and three kinds of ``tidal index,'' which quantify the local density environment. The catalog is supplemented with data based on the local galaxies, which presents their optical and available H{$\alpha$} images, as well as other services. We briefly discuss the Hubble flow within the LV and different scaling relations that characterize galaxy structure and global star formation in them. We also trace the behavior of the mean stellar mass density, H i-mass density, and star formation rate density within the volume considered.},

  abstract = {The majority of galaxies with current star formation rates (SFRs), \$\textbackslash rm SFR\_\{\textbackslash rm o\} \textbackslash ge 10\^\{-3\} \textbackslash, M\_\textbackslash odot\textbackslash,yr\^\{-1\}\$, in the Local Cosmological Volume, where observations should be reliable, have the property that their observed SFRo is larger than their average SFR. This is in tension with the evolution of galaxies described by delayed-{$\tau$} models, according to which the opposite would be expected. The tension is apparent in that local galaxies imply the star formation time-scale {$\tau~\approx$} 6.7~Gyr, much longer than the 3.5\textendash 4.5~Gyr obtained using an empirically determined main sequence at several redshifts. Using models where the SFR is a power law in time of the form {$\propto$}(t - t1){$\eta$} for t1~= 1.8~Gyr (with no stars forming prior to t1) implies that {$\eta~$}= 0.18~{$\pm~$}0.03. This suggested near-constancy of a galaxy's SFR over time raises non-trivial problems for the evolution and formation time of galaxies, but is broadly consistent with the observed decreasing main sequence with increasing age of the Universe.},

  abstract = {We conduct hydrodynamical MOND simulations of isolated disc galaxies over the stellar mass range M{$\star$}/M{$\odot$} = 107-1011 using the adaptive mesh refinement code PHANTOM OF RAMSES (POR), an adaptation of the RAMSES code with a Milgromian gravity solver. The scale lengths and gas fractions are based on observed galaxies, and the simulations are run for 5 Gyr. The main aim is to see whether the existing sub-grid physics prescriptions for star formation and stellar feedback reproduce the observed main sequence and reasonably match the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, which captures how the local and global star formation rates relate to other properties. Star formation in the models starts soon after initialization and continues as the models evolve. The initialized galaxies indeed evolve to a state which is on the observed main sequence and the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. The available formulation of sub-grid physics is therefore adequate and leads to galaxies that largely behave like observed galaxies, grow in radius, and have flat rotation curves - provided we use Milgromian gravitation. Furthermore, the strength of the bars tends to be inversely correlated with the stellar mass of the galaxy, whereas the bar length strongly correlates with the stellar mass. Irrespective of the mass, the bar pattern speed stays constant with time, indicating that dynamical friction does not affect the bar dynamics. The models demonstrate Renzo's rule and form structures at large radii, much as in real galaxies. In this framework, baryonic physics is thus sufficiently understood to not pose major uncertainties in our modelling of global galaxy properties.},
